# Documentation – OT Alerts Table (CORE + AI)

## Description

This component displays a list of OT alerts generated by both the **CORE** and **AI** detection engines. It focuses on showing the most relevant fields for quick review and decision-making.

---

## Displayed Fields

Each alert entry in the table includes the following fields:

- `@timestamp`
- `initial_seen`
- `last_seen`
- `asset_src`
- `asset_dst`
- `protocol`
- `detection`
- `severity`

These values provide a concise overview of the alert's context and risk level.

---

## Available Actions

- **Details Button**
  Redirects the user to the **Alert Details** page for the selected alert (`alert-details/:id`).

- **Delete/Disable Button** *(Planned – awaiting specifications)*
  In the future, this button will allow users to purge or suppress an alert.
  This action will be **logged and tracked** to ensure the same alert does not reappear, while maintaining traceability.

---

## Filtering Options

All fields displayed in the table must be **individually filterable**, including:

- Date/time ranges (`@timestamp`, `initial_seen`, `last_seen`)
- IP or asset information (`asset_src`, `asset_dst`)
- Protocol type
- Detection source (CORE or AI)
- Severity level

---

## Technical Notes

- Alerts should be retrieved from a unified data source aggregating CORE and AI detections.
- Filtering must be performed client-side or server-side depending on the volume of data.
- The **Details** action should preserve filters in navigation if needed (e.g., via query params).
- Future enhancements may include bulk actions (e.g., bulk delete, mark as reviewed).
